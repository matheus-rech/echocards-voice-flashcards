## 🚀 What's Deployed

### GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)
**URL:** https://matheus-rech.github.io/echocards-voice-flashcards/

**Deployed Components:**
- ✅ React 19.2.0 frontend
- ✅ UI components (all views and controls)
- ✅ Client-side logic
- ✅ localStorage persistence
- ✅ FSRS algorithm implementation

**⚠️ Limitations (No Backend):**
- ❌ No voice recognition (requires backend API)
- ❌ No AI features (deck generation, image generation, etc.)
- ❌ No API key protection (backend not deployed)
- ❌ No rate limiting (backend middleware not active)

**For Full Functionality:** Users must clone the repository and run both frontend and backend servers locally.

## 🔧 Automated CI/CD Workflows

### CI Workflow
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, pull requests
**Jobs:**
1. **Lint and Build** (Node.js 20.x, 22.x):
   - Install dependencies
   - Lint frontend and backend
   - Type check with TypeScript
   - Build frontend
   - Run backend tests

2. **Security Audit**:
   - Audit frontend dependencies
   - Audit backend dependencies

3. **Dependency Review** (PRs only):
   - Review dependency changes for security issues

### Deploy Workflow
**Triggers:** Push to main, manual trigger
**Jobs:**
1. **Build**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build production frontend
   - Upload build artifacts

2. **Deploy**:
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages environment
   - Update live site

**Deployment History:**

- ✅ CORS whitelist (localhost:3000 only for local development)
- ✅ Helmet security headers on backend
- ✅ Environment variables properly managed
- ✅ No secrets in commit history

### Security Workflows:
- ✅ Automated dependency audits via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Dependency review for pull requests
