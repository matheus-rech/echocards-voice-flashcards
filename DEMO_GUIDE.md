## üìù API Models Being Used

Your API key is currently using these Google Gemini models:

| Operation | Model | Cost (approx) |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Voice conversations | `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025` | ~$0.01 per minute |
| TTS (card reading) | `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` | ~$0.001 per card |
| Deck generation | `gemini-2.5-pro` | ~$0.10 per deck |
| Image generation | `imagen-4.0-generate-001` | ~$0.04 per image |
| Image analysis | `gemini-2.5-flash` | ~$0.001 per image |
| Text analysis (simple) | `gemini-2.5-flash` | ~$0.001 per request |
| Text analysis (complex) | `gemini-2.5-pro` | ~$0.01 per request |

**Estimated total cost for testing:** $1-2 USD for comprehensive testing session

---

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your API key is **WORKING** if:
- ‚úÖ Backend shows "API Key configured: ‚úÖ"
- ‚úÖ Voice commands trigger AI responses
- ‚úÖ Deck generation creates cards
- ‚úÖ Image generation produces images
- ‚úÖ No "Invalid API key" errors in backend logs
- ‚úÖ All operations show 200 status codes in backend

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Demo

1. **Create your own decks** using topics relevant to you
2. **Export your data** regularly (backup safety)
3. **Share decks** with others using CSV export
4. **Migrate to Anki** if needed using Anki export
5. **Monitor costs** at https://aistudio.google.com (quota tracking)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Anki .apkg Import
**Question:** Does it read Anki .apkg files?
**Answer:** **NO** - Currently only supports:
- CSV/TXT import (for creating new decks)
- JSON import (for restoring EchoCards backups)

To import from Anki:
1. Export from Anki as **Notes in Plain Text** (TXT/CSV format)
2. Use EchoCards "Import Deck" feature
3. Format: `Question, Answer, Explanation` (comma-separated)

### API Key Security
- Your API key is stored in `.env` files (gitignored)
- Never exposed in browser DevTools
- Protected by backend proxy
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
